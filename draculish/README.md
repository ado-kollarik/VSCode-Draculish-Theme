# Draculish Theme
## This is the README for the theme "draculish"

This theme is a fork of the original [Dracula Official](https://github.com/dracula/visual-studio-code) with some minor adjustments. The theme is optimized for various languages, I have made adjustments for Front-End development mainly.
